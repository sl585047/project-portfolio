      <h2>COM 372 Personal Narrative for Final Project Portfolio</h2>

    <p>For my final project, I decided to completely redesign and revamp The Bridal Suite of Hamilton’s web site in order to better their digital footprint and reachability with past, present, and potential customers. The site that is currently live that I also created before taking a web design class demonstrates the difficulty of using a hosting site to create a website when you haven’t been taught how to manipulate the code and get it to your liking. Although these sites make it easy for just about anyone to create a website, the tools and mechanics that are given to you are extremely basic and do not allow for free range in the creativity department. The current site is very basic and is in my opinion hideous (and I created it), I wasn’t sure what to do for color schemes, how to import other fonts for easier readability, and was unable to completely design by myself. </p>
      <p>
      That is why I decided to use this class as a tool for being able to completely revamp it manipulating it in the way that I want it to look. I wanted to create an easy to read and access site because the age range of the customers is anywhere from early 20s to late 70s. Therefore I found it important to make the site more simplistic and cut back on the amount of pages and information on the website currently. People like to be able to navigate a site quickly or essentially we will lose business. I took this into consideration while coding and creating this website.</p>
      <p>I struggled and am still struggling with not being able to achieve everything that I wanted with the site due to the level of expertise needed in order to implement the ideas I had, but that I realized that there are more simplistic and less appealing ways to do them and they will be fine for now. I also had a problem with the design and style of the website, as I stated previously I wanted to convey an easily accessible and readable site, I went back and forth with leaving the logo as the heading and if just regular type would suffice. I ended up going with the logo because that is all part of our brand identity, it is on everything that we give the girls. </p>
      <p>One aspect of the website that has been extremely helpful throughout this process is the grid system that boostrap offers. On almost every page, I have a grid system. It allows for me to align my content in a way that is eye catching and organized. At first this system seemed slightly confusing in the way that things are spaced and the size of the different columns, but after working with them on several of the different pages it is like muscle memory. The one thing that is difficult with the grid system is the inputting of images, although it adjusts to the size of the box, if a photo is say vertical it is more difficult for it to fill the entire column, therefore leaving spaces in between the different rows and columns.</p>
      <p>What I also found while making this site is that it is important to determine which fonts you’re going to use and stick to them. It is extremely important to pick at most two to three fonts and make sure they are readable and fit well together. I found that with the site that is currently live, cursive is extremely difficult to read in a small font, but because I had no idea how to import fonts to wix.com, I had to make the executive decision to make it all cursive. This was something I really took into consideration when creating my headers and then the paragraph or list items, all of my headings are in a cursive font, where as all of the other information is in a sans font for an easier read.</p>
      <p>The one thing that I can take away from this project and entire class in general is patience. It’s really easy to get frustrated when things don’t work, but all it takes is rescanning the document to check for spelling errors, missing code, or just simplistic errors. I’ve also learned that a lot of the fancy things you see on other websites are a little bit more difficult to achieve without knowledge of Javascript or other coding programs. The best feeling however is that there is a distinct amount of pride and happiness to be able to look at the site and say that I created it without the help of Wix or some other hosting site. Although it might not be as fancy with all of the widgets and apps they offer, being able to find ways to make it look similar and coding it yourself is a really great feeling. </p>

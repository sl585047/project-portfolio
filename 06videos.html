      <h4>Thoughts</h4>
        <p>I thought that these videos were very informative in a simple way. It gives you a basic run down of how webpages work with the internet, how different browsers display content differently, and lastly 3 different ways to write CSS and their effectiveness within your code. I really liked how he broke down the information in a slow and easy way to understand it. My favorite out of the 3 short videos was the last, when he talks about how to deal with CSS. He validates that as a basic and new learner one will typically use inline style elements and as a web designer progresses they will come to understand how to use external style sheets which in turn make styling so much easier. Another cool aspect that we have learned in class already would be the inspect element to find out what fonts or styles that these various sites use to produce the content you see and so that you can see how to do these similar things or to debug your own site.</p>
        <h4>Things I learned</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>How pages in a folder with HTML documents are just static website pages. I was wondering how they would all be interconnected. Then I realized that the pages we continue to link to our index.html file are separate pages that we can eventually stylize on that page to appear as different pages to our site.</li>
          <li>Something I knew already, but realizing the importance more than before...is to understand how to stylize in all aspects of CSS. Therefore when we move onto making an external style sheet we can better understand how it works and how much more efficent it is to read and code in this way.</li>
          <li>This is another thing that we have learned in class prior to this video but to install all of the popular browsers on our computers and to check our website and how it appears across all platforms. I wish I had know this when I was redesigning the Bridal Suite website. When I redesign it for a second time this will be something of great importance when finishing the project</li>

  <h2>2013/4, Death to Bullshit</h2>
    <div class="speakers"><h3>Brad Frost</h3></div>
  <h4>Thoughts</h4>
    <p>First off, I love that he continually picks up his cup of water to drink but doesn’t drink it until the end…Nervous antics or something I guess. But anyways, there was a lot of cool and useful information in this video. All of the things that have to deal with information in the beginning are all so true and fascinating. Continually on each site we are bombarded with a whole lot of bullshit on each page taking us away from what we actually want to see. This is so irritating and quite frankly may be why the younger generation has chronic ADD. Surveys, QR codes, and newsletters constantly disrupt us as if we want more bullshit in our lives and filling up our email accounts. When designing web pages, the most important thing is to give people the information that they are looking for in an easy to navigate and sleek design. That’s what people appreciate. We have to recognize that we don’t need to be part of the 90% of crap out there. We need to be the 10% of signal. Therefore channeling our inner craftiness and originality.</p>
      
  <h4>Things I learned</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Being passionate about the things that make you get out of bed in the morning is extremely important. Not only does this help to circumvent the possibilities of creativty and originality but it gives you the drive that you need to be different from the rest.</li>
      <li>Don't fog up a users experience with a page full of bullshit. Give them the information they are looking for and make it user friendly for all ages.(when I say ages, I typically mean the not so technologically inclined ones or older people like my mom...)</li>
      <li>Lastly, that craft is more appreciated. Good things take a lot of time, effort, and money. We need to stop falling into the trap that everything we read or see online is real. Start to zero in, focus, and filter out the bullshit that is thrown in our faces daily.</li>

  <h2>10 Things I didn't know about HTML</h2>
      <div class="speakers"><h3>Mathias Bynens</h3></div>
      <h4>Thoughts</h4>
      <p>
      Well this video was informative, but I felt awkward for the guy giving the talk. His jokes and shameless plugs to check out what looks like his website with all of the research he’s talking about were just bad. Maybe its Belgium humor…instead of this being 10 things I didn’t know about HTML it turned into to many things I didn’t know about HTML. Granted he’s probably been coding for long than I have though even though oddly enough he looks younger than me.  However he points out some really interesting points with some hacks and mistakes that validators can miss or humans can miss. Simple things such as leaving out a space, putting one in, using quotes vs. not using quotes, and omitting the semicolon can wreck your code completely. This is so important to note when visually checking our own codes, it’s crazy that one little thing such as those can make a world of difference. </p>
      <h4>Things I learned</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>I did not know that a majority of languages view semicolons as optional. This seems to be a hard feat for coders across the world. Omitting this important little guy could result in broken code or no code at all. Kinda crazy.</li> 
        <li>So if you start a HTML document with the DOCTYPE element and omit all the rest such as head and body, the browser already anticipates on them being there so it codes it for you. That's pretty cool...but I don't think as a novice developer that's smart to use because it kind of makes you lazy. I also though it was weird that you can style them even though they're not even in the document. Also...his joke was really bad at this point. You could tell he worked really hard on that one and no one found it funny. Poor guy.</li>
        <li>I can't remember if you told us this in class, but I had no idea that the p element could not be used inbetween the head elements. Because the certain holds that the DTD element has. Crazy that the p element is only allowed to be used inbetween the body tags.</li>
